Environment(Linux, Visual Studio Code)
How to compile the project:
Type 'make'
Example of how to run the project:
 ./oss -n 3 -s 2 -t 4 -i 0.6

 1. Added barebones functions and skeleton code given. (Esentially created github and files then uploaded)

 2.Started on command line parsing by taking function from other project and adding -i

 3.Added variables

 4.Added while loop to monitor how many children have terminated and how many need to launch

 5.Created another loop to continously see how many children are currenly running, if its not at the max run another child.

 6. added Clock struct.

 7. Logic was wrong of while loop launched < n is for if children still need to be created and pipes to running > 0 which checks if children are still alive.

 8. added simple for loop to take in values from the the pcb.

 9. fixed loop by initializing loop with pid_t pid;

 10.Logic was also messed up for the other loop

 11. Added the basic logic for the process table in/out loops just need to test correctly.

 12. Started working on increment clock function.

 13. while loop had semicolon behind it so it wouldn't loop, running wasn't declared.

 14. Fork only happened once in the loop because of the if statement. Put inside main loop.

 15.Compiled correctly now need to work on clock in shared memory.
